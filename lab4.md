**Experiment 4:** Create the /home/consultants directory.
Add write permission to the consultants group. Use the 
symbolic method for setting the appropriate permissions.
Forbid others from accessing files in
the /home/consultants directory. Use the octal method for 
setting the appropriate permissions.
Change the default umask for the operator1 user. The new 
umask prohibits all access for users that are not in their 
group. Confirm that the umask is changed.
